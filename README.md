### Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
I am inspired by imaging techniques that combine bright primary colours, geometric shapes, with grid-based layout. This kind of visual style provides me with a strong sense of rhythm and structure, which is visually engaging the audience. I would like to incorporate these elements into my major project by using coloured geometric shapes and a grid-based layout to create an artwork with a contemporary style. To achieve the visual approach, I plan to use functions in p5.js, which allows me to build well-structured, animated and interactive artwork.
